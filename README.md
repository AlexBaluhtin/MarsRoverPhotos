MarsRoverPhotosSwiftUI

MarsRoverPhotosSwiftUI is a simple application for viewing photos taken by NASA's rovers on the surface of Mars. The app allows users to select different rovers, cameras, and dates to view photos taken on a specific day with a specific camera.

Description
The application is developed using SwiftUI and follows the MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) architecture. It retrieves photo data from NASA's open API and displays it in a user-friendly interface.

Users can:

Select rovers (e.g., Curiosity, Opportunity, Spirit).
Choose cameras (e.g., Front Hazard Avoidance Camera, Mast Camera).
Select dates for which the photos were taken.
View photos filtered by the selected parameters.
Users can tap on any photo to view it in full-screen mode, allowing for a closer inspection of the details.

Technologies
